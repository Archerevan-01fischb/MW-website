MAILING LIST FORM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

The form is ready but needs your Gmail App Password to work.

STEP 1: Create Gmail App Password
----------------------------------
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Sign in with lane01evan@gmail.com
3. Under "App name", type: Midwinter Website
4. Click "Create"
5. Copy the 16-character password (format: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx)

STEP 2: Add Password to PHP Script
-----------------------------------
1. SSH into your NAS or use File Station
2. Edit: /share/Web/forms/mailing-list.php
3. Find line 53: $smtp_pass = 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD_HERE';
4. Replace YOUR_APP_PASSWORD_HERE with your app password
5. Save the file

Example:
$smtp_pass = 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop';  // Remove spaces: 'abcdefghijklmnop'

STEP 3: Test the Form
---------------------
1. Open the website recruit page
2. Fill out the mailing list form
3. Submit and check lane01evan@gmail.com

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
- Form submissions go to: forms/mailing-list.php
- PHP script sends email via Gmail SMTP to lane01evan@gmail.com
- All submissions are logged to: /share/Web/forms/mailing_list_log.csv
- Rate limiting: 1 submission per minute per IP address

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If email fails, check PHP error log on QNAP
- Make sure Gmail "Less secure app access" is OFF (app passwords work differently)
- Test with: ssh fischb@10.0.0.55 "php /share/Web/forms/mailing-list.php"

FILES CREATED:
--------------
- /share/Web/forms/mailing-list.php (main handler)
- /share/Web/forms/mailing_list_log.csv (submission log, auto-created)
- /share/Web/forms/.rate_limit_* (rate limit files, auto-created)
